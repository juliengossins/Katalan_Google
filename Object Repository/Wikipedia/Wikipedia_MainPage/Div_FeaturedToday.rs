From today's featured article


Kate Sheppard (1848–1934) was the most prominent member of the women's suffrage movement in New Zealand, and is one of that nation's best-known historical figures.  Born in Liverpool, England, she migrated to New Zealand with her family in 1868, joining religious and social organisations there, including the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). In 1887 she was appointed the WCTU's National Superintendent for Franchise and Legislation. Sheppard promoted women's suffrage by organising petitions and public meetings, by writing letters to the press, and by developing contacts with politicians. She was the editor of the White Ribbon, the first woman-operated newspaper in New Zealand. Through her skilful writing and persuasive public speaking, her work culminated in the grant of the vote to women on 19 September 1893, making New Zealand the first nation to grant universal suffrage.
